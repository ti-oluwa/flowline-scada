## 3. Mathematical Formulation

The system implements industry-standard flow equations that automatically select the appropriate model based on fluid properties, pipe characteristics, and operating conditions. All formulations use petroleum engineering conventions with support for both compressible (gas) and incompressible (liquid) flow.

### 3.1 Reynolds Number and Flow Regime

The Reynolds number determines whether flow is laminar or turbulent:

$$
Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu} = \frac{4 \rho Q}{\pi D \mu}
$$

Where:

- $Re$ = Reynolds number (dimensionless)
- $\rho$ = Fluid density (kg/m³)
- $v$ = Average flow velocity (m/s)
- $D$ = Internal pipe diameter (m)
- $\mu$ = Dynamic viscosity (Pa·s)
- $Q$ = Volumetric flow rate (m³/s)

**Flow Regimes:**

- **Laminar flow**: $Re < 2000$
- **Transitional flow**: $2000 \leq Re \leq 4000$
- **Turbulent flow**: $Re > 4000$

### 3.2 Friction Factor Calculation

The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor is calculated based on the flow regime:

**For Laminar Flow** ($Re < 2000$):

$$
f = \frac{64}{Re}
$$

**For Smooth Turbulent Pipes** ($4000 < Re < 100000$ and $\varepsilon = 0$):

Blasius correlation:

$$
f = \frac{0.3164}{Re^{0.25}}
$$

**For Rough Turbulent Pipes** (Colebrook-White equation, solved iteratively):

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}} = -2 \log_{10}\left(\frac{\varepsilon/D}{3.7} + \frac{2.51}{Re\sqrt{f}}\right)
$$

Where:

- $f$ = Darcy friction factor (dimensionless)
- $\varepsilon$ = Absolute pipe roughness (m)
- $\varepsilon/D$ = Relative roughness (dimensionless)

### 3.3 Flow Equation Selection

The system automatically selects the appropriate flow equation based on these criteria:

| Condition | Equation Used |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Liquid flow** or **Incompressible flow type** | Darcy-Weisbach |
| **Gas, Long pipeline** (L > 20 miles) and D ≥ 12 inches | Modified Panhandle A |
| **Gas, Long pipeline** (L > 20 miles) and D < 12 inches | Modified Panhandle B |
| **Gas, Short/medium pipeline** (L ≤ 20 miles) | Weymouth |

### 3.4 Darcy-Weisbach Equation (Incompressible Flow)

For liquid pipelines and low-pressure-drop gas lines, the petroleum engineering form:

$$
Q = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta P \cdot D^5}{0.0000115 \cdot f \cdot L \cdot SG}}
$$

Where:

- $Q$ = Flow rate (bbl/day, converted to ft³/s)
- $\Delta P$ = Pressure drop (psi)
- $D$ = Internal diameter (inches)
- $f$ = Darcy friction factor (dimensionless)
- $L$ = Pipe length (feet)
- $SG$ = Specific gravity relative to water for liquids (dimensionless)

**Inverse form for pressure drop:**

$$
\Delta P = \frac{0.0000115 \cdot f \cdot L \cdot SG \cdot Q^2}{D^5}
$$

### 3.5 Weymouth Equation (Gas Flow)

For short to medium gas pipelines with fully turbulent flow:

$$
Q = 433.5 \cdot \frac{T_{sc}}{P_{sc}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{P_1^2 - e^s \cdot P_2^2}{SG \cdot L' \cdot T \cdot Z}} \cdot D^{2.667} \cdot E
$$

Where:

- $Q$ = Gas flow rate (scf/day at standard conditions)
- $T_{sc}$ = Standard temperature (520°R = 60°F)
- $P_{sc}$ = Standard pressure (14.7 psi)
- $P_1$ = Upstream pressure (psi)
- $P_2$ = Downstream pressure (psi)
- $SG$ = Gas specific gravity relative to air (dimensionless)
- $L'$ = Corrected pipeline length (miles)
- $T$ = Average gas temperature (°R)
- $Z$ = Compressibility factor (dimensionless)
- $D$ = Internal diameter (inches)
- $E$ = Pipeline efficiency factor (0-1, dimensionless)

**Elevation Correction:**

$$
s = \frac{0.0375 \cdot SG \cdot \Delta h}{T}
$$

$$
L' = \begin{cases}
L & \text{if } s = 0 \\
\frac{L(e^s - 1)}{s} & \text{if } s \neq 0
\end{cases}
$$

Where $\Delta h$ is elevation difference (feet).

### 3.6 Modified Panhandle A Equation

For large-diameter, long-distance gas transmission lines:

$$
Q = 435.87 \cdot \left(\frac{T_{sc}}{P_{sc}}\right)^{1.0788} \cdot \left(\frac{P_1^2 - e^s \cdot P_2^2}{SG^{0.8539} \cdot L' \cdot T \cdot Z}\right)^{0.5394} \cdot D^{2.6182} \cdot E
$$

Same elevation correction as Weymouth equation applies.

### 3.7 Modified Panhandle B Equation

For smaller-diameter gas pipelines with partially turbulent flow:

$$
Q = 737 \cdot \left(\frac{T_{sc}}{P_{sc}}\right)^{1.02} \cdot \left(\frac{P_1^2 - e^s \cdot P_2^2}{SG^{0.961} \cdot L' \cdot T \cdot Z}\right)^{0.51} \cdot D^{2.52} \cdot E
$$

### 3.8 Compressibility Factor

The system uses **CoolProp** thermodynamic library to calculate the real gas compressibility factor:

$$
Z = \frac{PV}{nRT}
$$

CoolProp implements the Peng-Robinson equation of state internally, providing accurate Z-factors for natural gas mixtures at pipeline conditions.

### 3.9 Leak Detection Model

#### 3.9.1 Orifice Flow Equation

When a leak occurs, fluid escapes through an orifice. The volumetric leak rate is calculated using:

$$
Q_{leak} = C_d \cdot A_{leak} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta P}{\rho}}
$$

Where:

- $Q_{leak}$ = Volumetric leak rate (m³/s)
- $C_d$ = Discharge coefficient (typically 0.6 for sharp-edged orifice)
- $A_{leak}$ = Leak orifice area (m²) = $\frac{\pi D_{leak}^2}{4}$
- $\Delta P$ = Pressure difference: $P_{pipe} - P_{ambient}$ (Pa)
- $\rho$ = Fluid density (kg/m³)

**Key Features:**

- Leak only occurs if internal pressure exceeds ambient pressure
- Pressure at leak location estimated by linear interpolation
- Multiple leaks calculated individually and summed
- Active/inactive status allows scenario testing

#### 3.9.2 Leak Severity Classification

Leaks are classified by diameter for visualization:

| Leak Diameter | Severity Category |
|---------------|-------------------|
| < 1 mm | Pinhole |
| 1-3 mm | Small |
| 3-10 mm | Moderate |
| 10-25 mm | Large |
| > 25 mm | Critical |

### 3.10 Flow Balance for Leak Detection

The fundamental principle for leak detection is volumetric flow balance:

$$
Q_{in} = Q_{out} + Q_{leak,total}
$$

For mass-based detection (more accurate for gases):

$$
\dot{m}_{in} = \dot{m}_{out} + \dot{m}_{leak,total}
$$

Where:

- $\dot{m} = \rho \cdot Q$ = Mass flow rate
- $Q_{leak,total} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Q_{leak,i}$ = Sum of all active leaks

**Leak Detection Criterion:**

$$
Q_{imbalance} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}
$$

A leak is indicated when $Q_{imbalance} > \epsilon$ (threshold based on measurement accuracy).

### 3.11 Thermodynamic Property Calculation

The system uses **CoolProp** library to compute real-time fluid properties from pressure and temperature:

**Density:**
$$
\rho = f(P, T, \text{fluid})
$$

**Dynamic Viscosity:**
$$
\mu = f(P, T, \text{fluid})
$$

**Compressibility Factor:**
$$
Z = f(P, T, \text{fluid})
$$

**Molecular Weight:**
$$
M = \text{constant for pure fluid}
$$

These properties update dynamically as conditions change, ensuring accurate flow calculations throughout the pipeline.

## 4. System Implementation

### 4.1 Flowline Simulator

The flowline simulator is the core computational engine that models pipeline behavior in real-time using industry-standard equations.

#### 4.1.1 Pipeline Discretization

The physical pipeline is divided into discrete segments (pipes), each modeled as an independent component with:

**Geometric Properties:**

- Length (ft, miles, m)
- Internal diameter (inches, mm)
- Material type and absolute roughness (m)
- Elevation difference between inlet and outlet (ft, m)

**Operating Conditions:**

- Upstream pressure (psi, Pa)
- Downstream pressure (psi, Pa)
- Efficiency factor (0-1)

**Fluid Properties:**

- Fluid type (from CoolProp database: Methane, CO2, Water, etc.)
- Pressure and temperature (calculated from CoolProp)
- Density, viscosity, compressibility factor
- Phase (liquid or gas)

**Leak Configurations:**

- Location along pipe (0.0 to 1.0 fraction)
- Diameter (mm)
- Discharge coefficient (typically 0.6)
- Active/inactive status for scenario testing

**Sequential Pipeline Structure:**

```text
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Pipe 1    │───▶│   Pipe 2    │───▶│   Pipe 3    │
│ P₁→P₂, Q₁   │    │ P₂→P₃, Q₂   │    │ P₃→P₄, Q₃   │
│ Leak @ 0.5  │    │  No leaks   │    │ Leak @ 0.3  │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

Each pipe segment:

1. Receives upstream conditions from previous segment
2. Determines appropriate flow equation based on criteria
3. Calculates flow rate using selected equation
4. Computes leak rates at specified locations
5. Outputs downstream conditions for next segment

#### 4.1.2 Computation Algorithm

The system uses a direct calculation approach (not iterative) based on pressure boundary conditions:

**For each pipe segment:**

```python
# 1. Determine flow equation
flow_equation = determine_pipe_flow_equation(
    pressure_drop, upstream_pressure, 
    internal_diameter, length, 
    fluid_phase, flow_type
)

# 2. Calculate Reynolds number (initial estimate)
Re = compute_reynolds_number(
    flow_rate_estimate, diameter, 
    fluid_density, fluid_viscosity
)

# 3. Calculate friction factor (if Darcy-Weisbach)
if Re < 2000:
    f = 64 / Re
elif Re <= 100000 and roughness == 0:
    f = 0.3164 / Re^0.25
else:
    # Colebrook-White (iterative)
    solve for f

# 4. Compute flow rate using selected equation
Q = compute_pipe_flow_rate(
    length, diameter, P_upstream, P_downstream,
    roughness, efficiency, elevation,
    specific_gravity, temperature, Z, Re,
    flow_equation
)

# 5. Calculate leak rates
if leaks_present:
    for each leak:
        P_leak = P_upstream - (P_drop × leak.location)
        Q_leak_i = leak.compute_rate(P_leak, P_ambient, ρ)
    Q_total_leak = sum(Q_leak_i)
    Q_outlet = Q - Q_total_leak
else:
    Q_outlet = Q

# 6. Update outlet conditions
P_downstream → P_upstream_next
Q_outlet → Q_upstream_next
```

**No Iterative Convergence Required** because:

- Each pipe has fixed pressure boundary conditions
- Flow equations directly solve for Q given P₁ and P₂
- Leaks calculated independently based on local pressure

#### 4.1.3 Leak Simulation Process

When simulating a leak scenario:

**Step 1: Baseline Configuration**

- Set up pipeline with normal operating pressures
- Define fluid properties and temperatures
- Calculate baseline flow rates without leaks

**Step 2: Leak Introduction**

- Add leak to specific pipe segment
- Specify: location (0.0-1.0), diameter (mm), discharge coefficient
- Set active status = True

**Step 3: Leak Rate Calculation**

- Estimate pressure at leak location: $P_{leak} = P_1 - \Delta P \times location$
- Calculate pressure differential: $\Delta P = P_{leak} - P_{ambient}$
- Apply orifice equation: $Q_{leak} = C_d A \sqrt{2\Delta P/\rho}$

**Step 4: Flow Distribution**

- Inlet flow rate unchanged (upstream boundary condition)
- Outlet flow rate = Inlet flow rate - Total leak rate
- System automatically shows flow imbalance

**Step 5: Visual and Metric Updates**

- Leak indicator appears on pipeline visualization
- Flow meters show inlet vs outlet discrepancy
- Leak rate meter displays total leakage
- Color coding reflects pressure distribution

**Leak Parameters:**

- **Location**: 0.0 = inlet, 1.0 = outlet
- **Diameter**: Physical hole size (affects area)
- **Discharge Coefficient**: 0.6 (sharp orifice) to 0.8 (rounded)
- **Active Status**: Toggle for scenario comparison

### 4.2 SCADA Interface Design

The system replicates industrial SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) interfaces used in real pipeline operations.

#### 4.2.1 Flow Stations

Two flow stations monitor pipeline endpoints:

**Upstream Station (Inlet):**

- **Pressure Gauge**: Displays inlet pressure with configurable alarm limits
- **Temperature Gauge**: Monitors gas temperature
- **Flow Meter**: Shows volumetric flow rate entering pipeline (ft³/s)
- **Pressure Regulator**: Interactive control to adjust inlet pressure
- **Temperature Regulator**: Control to set gas temperature

**Downstream Station (Outlet):**

- **Pressure Gauge**: Displays outlet pressure
- **Temperature Gauge**: Monitors exit temperature
- **Flow Meter**: Actual outlet volumetric flow rate (ft³/s)
- **Mass Flow Meter**: Mass flow rate (lb/s) = ρ × Q
- **Expected Flow Meter**: Theoretical flow without leaks (for comparison)
- **Leak Rate Meter**: Total system leak rate = Q_in - Q_out
- **Pressure Regulator**: Back-pressure control

**Key Feature - Leak Detection:**
Comparing "Flow Meter" (actual) vs "Expected Flow Meter" (theoretical) instantly reveals leaks.

#### 4.2.2 Visual Pipeline Representation

Interactive SVG-based visualization provides real-time pipeline status:

**Visual Elements:**

- **Pipe Segments**: Individual SVG components for each pipe
- **Color Coding**: Rate-based (configurable, typically blue=low, green=moderate, red=high)
- **Flow Direction**: Animated arrows showing flow direction
- **Leak Indicators**:
  - Visual markers at leak locations
  - Spray particles animated to show escaping gas
  - Color-coded by severity (yellow=small, red=large)
- **Connectors**: Joints between pipe segments
- **Flow Particles**: Animated dots moving through pipes (speed ∝ flow rate)

**Real-time Updates:**

The interface updates every 500 milliseconds to reflect:

- Pressure changes throughout pipeline
- Flow rate variations due to leaks or control changes
- Leak activation/deactivation
- Temperature effects on gas properties

**Interactive Features:**

- Click pipes to view detailed properties
- Hover for tooltips with flow/pressure data
- Zoom and pan for large pipelines
- Scale factor adjustment for clarity

#### 4.2.3 Control Panel

The operator interface provides comprehensive configuration tools:

**Flowline Builder:**

- **Add Pipes**: Define length, diameter, material, roughness
- **Reorder Pipes**: Change pipeline sequence
- **Remove Pipes**: Delete segments
- **Set Pressures**: Configure inlet/outlet pressures for each segment
- **Elevation**: Specify height differences
- **Efficiency**: Set pipeline efficiency factor (0-1)

**Leak Management:**

- **Add Leak**: Select pipe, specify location, diameter, discharge coefficient
- **Configure Parameters**: Adjust leak properties
- **Activate/Deactivate**: Toggle leaks on/off for scenario testing
- **View Summary**: Table showing all leaks with location and severity
- **Clear All Leaks**: Remove all leaks from system

**Fluid Properties Configuration:**

- **Fluid Selection**: Choose from CoolProp database (Methane, CO2, etc.)
- **Inlet Temperature**: Set gas temperature at inlet
- **Inlet Pressure**: Set starting pressure
- **Flow Type**: Select compressible or incompressible
- **Ambient Pressure**: Set external pressure (for leak calculations)

**Configuration Management:**

- **Export Configuration**: Save complete pipeline setup to JSON file
  - Includes: all pipe properties, fluid settings, leak configurations
  - Timestamped for version control
  - Human-readable format
  
- **Import Configuration**: Load previously saved scenarios
  - Validates data integrity
  - Restores complete system state
  - Useful for training scenarios and emergency planning

### 4.3 Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses a publish-subscribe pattern ensuring all UI components stay synchronized:

**Event Flow:**

```text
User Action → Pipeline Manager → Event Notification → UI Components Update
```

**Event Types:**

- `pipeline.pipe.added` - New pipe segment added to flowline
- `pipeline.pipe.updated` - Pipe properties changed (pressure, diameter, etc.)
- `pipeline.pipe.removed` - Pipe segment deleted
- `pipeline.properties.updated` - Fluid or global properties changed
- `pipeline.leaks.cleared` - Leaks removed or deactivated
- `pipeline.validation.changed` - Configuration validation status changed

**Benefits:**

- **Automatic Synchronization**: All meters, gauges, and visualizations update automatically
- **No Manual Refresh**: Changes propagate instantly through event system
- **Decoupled Components**: UI elements independent of calculation engine
- **Real-time Response**: Sub-second updates for interactive operation

### 4.4 Equation Selection Logic

The system intelligently selects flow equations based on physical conditions:

**Selection Criteria (from `determine_pipe_flow_equation`):**

```python
if fluid_phase == "liquid" or flow_type == INCOMPRESSIBLE:
    return DARCY_WEISBACH
    
# For gases (compressible flow):
if length > 20 miles:
    if diameter >= 12 inches:
        return MODIFIED_PANHANDLE_A  # Large diameter transmission
    else:
        return MODIFIED_PANHANDLE_B  # Smaller diameter
else:
    return WEYMOUTH  # Short/medium pipelines
```

This ensures physically appropriate models are used without manual selection by the operator.

## 5. Leak Detection Strategy

### 5.1 Detection Method Implemented

The system uses a **Flow Balance Method** based on direct comparison of inlet and outlet flow rates.

#### 5.1.1 Volumetric Flow Balance

**Principle:** Monitor flow rate discrepancy between inlet and outlet

$$
\Delta Q = Q_{in} - Q_{out}
$$

**Leak Indication:** $\Delta Q > 0$ indicates flow loss to leakage

**Implementation:**

- **Inlet Flow Meter**: Measures flow entering pipeline (unaffected by leaks)
- **Outlet Flow Meter**: Measures actual flow exiting pipeline
- **Expected Flow Meter**: Calculates theoretical outlet flow (no leaks)
- **Leak Rate Meter**: Displays $\Delta Q = Q_{in} - Q_{out}$

**Advantages:**

- **Simple and Reliable**: Direct measurement, easy to interpret
- **Real-time Detection**: Immediate response to flow changes
- **Quantitative**: Provides exact leak rate magnitude
- **No Baseline Required**: Works from startup without calibration

**Limitations:**

- **No Location Information**: Cannot pinpoint where leak occurs
- **Steady-State**: Most accurate during stable flow conditions
- **Single Point Measurement**: Requires flow meters at endpoints only

#### 5.1.2 Mass Flow Balance (Optional)

For gas pipelines, mass-based detection provides higher accuracy:

$$
\Delta \dot{m} = \dot{m}_{in} - \dot{m}_{out}
$$

Where:

$$
\dot{m} = \rho \cdot Q
$$

**Advantages over Volumetric:**

- **Accounts for Compressibility**: Gas density changes don't affect accuracy
- **More Accurate**: Not influenced by pressure/temperature variations
- **Better for Long Pipelines**: Compensates for gas expansion

The system displays both volumetric and mass flow rates at the downstream station.

### 5.2 Leak Visualization

The system provides multiple visual indicators for leak identification:

#### 5.2.1 Meter Comparison

**Primary Indicators:**

1. **Flow Discrepancy**: Outlet meter < Inlet meter
2. **Leak Rate Meter**: Shows explicit leak rate
3. **Expected vs Actual**: Direct comparison on display

**Example Display:**

```text
INLET STATION          OUTLET STATION
Flow: 8.5 ft³/s       Flow: 6.2 ft³/s (Actual)
                      Expected: 8.5 ft³/s
                      Leak Rate: 2.3 ft³/s ⚠️
```

#### 5.2.2 Pipeline Visualization

**Leak Indicators on SVG Pipeline:**

- **Marker Location**: Visual indicator at leak position along pipe
- **Color Coding**:
  - Yellow: Pinhole/small leaks (< 3mm)
  - Orange: Moderate leaks (3-10mm)
  - Red: Large/critical leaks (> 10mm)
- **Animated Spray**: Particle effects showing gas escaping
- **Pulsing Effect**: Opacity animation draws attention to active leaks

#### 5.2.3 Severity Classification

Automatic classification based on leak diameter:

| Diameter | Severity | Typical Q_leak* | Visual Color |
|----------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| < 1 mm | Pinhole | < 0.01 ft³/s | Yellow |
| 1-3 mm | Small | 0.01-0.1 ft³/s | Light Orange |
| 3-10 mm | Moderate | 0.1-0.5 ft³/s | Orange |
| 10-25 mm | Large | 0.5-2 ft³/s | Red |
| > 25 mm | Critical | > 2 ft³/s | Dark Red |

*Approximate leak rates for natural gas at 100 psi

### 5.3 Alarm and Alert System

While the current implementation focuses on visual indication, the architecture supports configurable alarm thresholds:

**Potential Alarm Levels:**

**Warning (Yellow):**

- Flow imbalance: 2-5% of nominal flow
- Gradual pressure decline
- Single small leak detected

**High Alarm (Orange):**

- Flow imbalance: 5-10% of nominal flow  
- Moderate pressure drop rate
- Multiple leaks or single moderate leak

**Critical Alarm (Red):**

- Flow imbalance: > 10% of nominal flow
- Rapid pressure decline
- Large or critical leak detected

### 5.4 Detection Accuracy and Limitations

#### 5.4.1 Minimum Detectable Leak

**Theoretical Sensitivity:**

The minimum detectable leak depends on flow meter accuracy:

$$
Q_{leak,min} = \epsilon \cdot Q_{nominal}
$$

Where $\epsilon$ is the meter accuracy (typically 0.5-2%).

**Example:** For nominal flow of 10 ft³/s with 1% meter accuracy:

- Minimum detectable leak ≈ 0.1 ft³/s
- Corresponds to ~5mm hole at 100 psi

#### 5.4.2 Response Time

- **Computational**: Instantaneous (< 100ms)
- **Visual Update**: 500ms refresh rate
- **Practical Detection**: Depends on leak size and flow stabilization

#### 5.4.3 Current Limitations

**No Implementation of:**

- **Leak Location**: System doesn't automatically determine where leak is
- **Historical Trending**: No data logging or pattern analysis  
- **Pressure Wave Analysis**: Transient methods not implemented
- **Multiple Segment Isolation**: No automated valve control logic

**User Must:**

- Visually inspect pipeline diagram for leak location
- Manually test different segments by adding/removing leaks
- Rely on operator knowledge for interpretation

---

## 6. Emergency Response Planning

### 6.1 Scenario Simulation

The system enables operators to simulate various failure scenarios:

#### 6.1.1 Leak Scenario Configuration

**Parameters:**

- **Leak Size**: Small (< 5mm), Medium (5-20mm), Large (> 20mm)
- **Location**: Percentage along pipeline (0-100%)
- **Discharge Coefficient**: Orifice characteristic (0.4-0.8)
- **Activation Time**: When leak occurs (for transient analysis)

#### 6.1.2 "What-If" Analysis

Operators can test:

1. **Response Time Impact**: How quickly must valve closure occur?
2. **Isolation Strategy**: Which sections to isolate?
3. **Pressure Management**: Optimal bleed-down procedures?
4. **Inventory Loss**: Expected gas loss over time?

**Example Workflow:**

```
1. Configure normal operation (baseline)
2. Add simulated leak at station X
3. Observe system response (pressure, flow changes)
4. Test isolation valve closure
5. Evaluate residual pressure and inventory
6. Document response procedure
```

## 10. Limitations and Future Work

### 10.1 Current Limitations

**Computational:**

- **Steady-State Only**: System calculates equilibrium flow rates, no transient analysis
- **No Pack/Unpack Effects**: Doesn't model gas compression/decompression in pipe volume
- **Single Phase Flow**: No multiphase (oil-gas-water) modeling capability
- **Simplified Geometry**: Assumes circular cross-section, no bends/fittings/valves modeled explicitly

**Leak Detection:**

- **No Automated Location**: System shows leak exists but doesn't calculate where
- **No Historical Data**: No data logging, trending, or statistical analysis
- **Manual Leak Placement**: User must add leaks manually (not real sensor-driven)
- **No Pressure Wave Methods**: Doesn't use transient pressure analysis

**Operational:**

- **No Real Hardware Integration**: Simulated SCADA only, no actual sensor connections
- **No Control Logic**: No automated valve operation or emergency shutdown sequences
- **No Uncertainty Modeling**: Assumes perfect sensors and measurements
- **Limited Network Analysis**: Single pipeline only, no complex network topologies

### 10.2 Planned Enhancements

**Phase 1 (Immediate):**

- **Data Logging**: Store flow rates, pressures, leak events over time
- **Historical Plots**: Trending charts for operational parameters
- **Export Reports**: Generate PDF/CSV reports of pipeline state
- **Alarm Configuration**: User-definable thresholds with audio/visual alerts

**Phase 2 (Short-term):**

- **Transient Analysis**: Model flow changes over time during startup/shutdown
- **Leak Localization**: Implement pressure wave-based location algorithms
- **Multiple Scenario Comparison**: Side-by-side testing of different configurations
- **Enhanced Visualization**: 3D pipeline representation, geographic overlay

**Phase 3 (Long-term):**

- **Hardware Integration**: Connect to real flow meters, pressure transducers
- **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection using historical data patterns
- **Network Topology**: Multiple pipelines, junctions, storage facilities
- **Mobile Interface**: Remote monitoring via smartphone/tablet apps
